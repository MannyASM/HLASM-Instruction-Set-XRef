# HLASM-Instruction-Set-XRef
Based on z390 ZOPCHECK.CPY (courtesy Don Higgins), this is an Excel xref that allows for quick search by mnemonic or opcode.

For further reference see z390.info - z390 Portable Mainframe Assembler, Linker, and Emulator Open Source Project.

Overview
----------
Within Z390, Don and his team have a great tool called ZOPCHECK - a macro assembler program which runs on the open source z390 Portable Mainframe Assembler and on the IBM mainframe High Level Assembler (HLASM).

ZOPCHECK.CPY is a file that contains the instruction set found in Architecture Principles of Operation (SA22-7832-12).

This Excel tool parses each line in that copybook and organizes the data in a way that is easily sorted and searchable.

This is intended to help software developers using IBM Assembly Language quickly reference mnemonics and opcodes, their operands, etc.

Enjoy!
